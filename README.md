# TherapyBot ðŸ¤–ðŸ’­

A mental health-focused chatbot powered by advanced language models and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology. This application provides therapeutic conversations while leveraging evidence-based mental health resources.

## Features

- ðŸ§  Conversational AI with mental health expertise
- ðŸ“š RAG-based responses using verified mental health documentation
- ðŸ’¬ Interactive chat interface built with Streamlit
- ðŸ”„ Conversation memory for contextual responses
- ðŸ“‘ Document processing with PDF support

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Streamlit-based interactive web interface
- **Language Model**: Integration with HuggingFace models
- **RAG System**: Custom implementation using:
  - Document processing (PyMuPDF)
  - Vector storage (Chroma)
  - Embedding generation (HuggingFace)
  - Memory management (LangChain)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Meggison/therapybot.git
cd therapybot
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501` by default.
