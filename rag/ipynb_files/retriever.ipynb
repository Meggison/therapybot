       " Document(page_content='Introduction  \\n \\n \\nMost of us can feel miserable, sad or ‘down in the dumps’ at times. \\nWe might feel like this when someone we love has died or moved \\naway, or if we have lost a job, or had stressful or difficult things to \\ncope with. Usually these feelings fade over time, especially when \\npeople have other good things happening in their lives. This is ‘feeling \\ndepressed’ or ‘sad’ and is not a depressive illness.\\nWhen these feelings are intense and persistent, and stop us from \\ndoing the things we would usually do over a period of weeks or \\nlonger, it is likely to be depressive illness. Even when circumstances and \\nrelationships improve, a person with depressive illness will find their \\nlow mood still persists. Despite their best efforts, and the efforts of \\nthose close to them, they are unable to ‘feel good’ again. There may \\nbe problems with poor sleep or change in appetite. \\nDepressive illness can vary from just interfering with usual activities and \\nrelationships (mild to moderate depression), to being very debilitating \\n(severe or ‘major depression’). Severe depression can make it hard or \\neven impossible for the person to relate and communicate with others, \\nor to do day-to-day tasks. People sometimes:\\n•  lose the will to live\\n•  become totally withdrawn and isolate themselves\\n•  feel ‘trapped’ in their lifestyle and can see no way out of it\\n•  may even feel guilty about being depressed because they ‘have \\neverything’ or don’t feel they have a reason to be depressed\\n•  feel worthless or hopeless\\n•  believe that they are a burden to others.\\n5\\n4\\n6 Effective treatment may include ‘talking \\ntherapies’ such as cognitive behavioural therapy \\n(CBT) and other psychological therapies and/or \\nanti-depressant medications.\\n7 There is a range of other strategies to assist \\nin the treatment of depression, such as diet, \\nexercise and alternative medicines. Medical \\ntreatments and other strategies can be adapted \\nto the individual and are often mutually \\nenhancing.\\n8 It is common practice for families and carers to be \\ninvolved in providing support to those suffering \\ndepression. Many services are available to \\nsupport families and carers. \\n9 Treating depression early is important to get the \\nbest outcomes.\\n10 Some people are at higher risk of developing \\ndepression, and certain events during people’s \\nlives can also increase a person’s risk of suffering \\ndepression.\\n', metadata={'source': '/Users/misanmeggison/Downloads/AUS_Depression _consumer and carer tx guidelines.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/misanmeggison/Downloads/AUS_Depression _consumer and carer tx guidelines.pdf', 'page': 3, 'total_pages': 17, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS2 (4.0)', 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 7.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20090908104936+10'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20090908105009+10'00'\", 'trapped': ''}),\n",

The therapist aims to work with you on the \\nway you react to circumstances and relationships. There are several \\npsychological therapies that can be used to treat depression. Two \\ntypes of therapy have been shown to be most effective: Cognitive \\nBehavioural Therapy (CBT) and Interpersonal Therapy (IPT).

It is important to discuss side effects with your doctor \\nwhen choosing a medication. You should also discuss any side effects \\nyou experience as your treatment progresses.\\nSSRIs are used most often, as they are less likely to cause side effects. \\nHowever, some people find they cause nausea, particularly in the \\nfirst week of treatment.

Very rarely, they \\ncan cause extreme agitation, jerky movements, a high temperature \\nand confusion – if this occurs, it is important to seek urgent medical \\nattention, as people with this ‘serotonin syndrome’ can become very  \\nill if they are not treated. This is more likely if SSRIs are combined  \\nwith certain other anti-depressants or some natural remedies, e.g.  \\nSt John’s Wort.\\nSide effects of SNRIs may include nausea, reduced appetite, headache, \\nsweating, rashes, agitation and sexual difficulties.\\nSide effects of TCAs include a dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, \\ndifficulty urinating, sedation, sexual problems and weight gain. It is \\nnot a good idea to drink alcohol when depressed as it tends to worsen \\nthe depression and increase risk of suicide.

Any treatment provided by these \\nhealth professionals will only be rebated by Medicare if you have \\npreviously claimed a rebate for a GP Mental Health Treatment Plan. A GP \\nMental Health Treatment Plan will be developed by your GP and tailored \\nto your needs to find the treatment that is right for you, monitor your \\nprogress and assist you in achieving your goals for recovery. \\nMedicare rebates are also available for assessment and treatment by a \\npsychiatrist. A psychiatrist may also refer you for Medicare-subsidised \\ntreatment with a psychologist, an appropriately trained social worker or \\noccupational therapist. You may receive up to 12 individual/and or group \\ntherapy sessions in a year. An additional six individual sessions may be \\navailable in exceptional circumstances. \\nYour GP may also refer you to other government funded providers  \\nof psychological services depending on what is available in your  \\nlocal area.\\nWhile large out of pocket costs may discourage people from getting \\nprofessional help, treatment for depression can help you get better  \\nfaster, give you the skills to recognise depression early and possibly \\nprevent depression recurring in the future.
